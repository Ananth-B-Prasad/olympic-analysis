# Introduction

Whilst watching the Olympics in 2021, I was struck by how well the host nation, Japan, were doing. It got me thinking: Does hosting the Olympics improve performance in the medals table? To answer this, I will perform an eda along with some statistical tests.

Software tool: Use of maptlotlib, seaborn and folium.

Dataset taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results

Reference (codes taken from this site): http://surl.li/crku

Note: 1)I wasn't able to paste images of the result, so sent the link of it instead
      2)I couldn't load my csv file to Jupiter, so I did it with 3rd party sites
