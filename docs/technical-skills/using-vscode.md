# Using VS Code

## Introduction

A data scientist will often need to explore a data set stored in one or more
files, edit a Python program, or run a Python program --- all tasks that you can
accomplish in a text editor like VS Code. The team that creates and maintains
the [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) text editor describes it as "code
editing redefined" and points out that it is "free" and "built on open source"
and that it "runs everywhere". Sounds nice, huh? After you have reviewed the
content on VS Code's web site, follow the instructions there to install it in on
the computer that you will use when learning more about how to conduct research
in data science. Now, go ahead and take some time to customize your text editor
so that it uses a color scheme, layout, and font that matches your personal
style!

## Extensions

To complete your setup of VS Code, please read about, install, configure, and
practice using the following VS Code extensions! While some of the extensions in
the following list are mandatory for you to become a successful proactive
programmer who uses Python (e.g., the [Python extension from
Microsoft](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)),
others are optionally installed at your discretion if you think the would be
helpful (e.g., [Bookmarks from Alessandro
Fragnani](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.Bookmarks)).
You might also be interested in using an extension to run [Jupyter
Notebooks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter).

Make sure that you also explore extensions in each of the following categories!
