# Problem Domains

## Introduction

Conducting research in data science means that you need to pick a problem domain
in which you are most interested in learning through the use of data. For
instance, are you interested in sneakers or video games or an athletic sport? If
you have interest in one of these areas then you have picked your problem
domain! After selecting a broad problem domain and then taking the next step of
identifying a [knowledge gap](/research-skills/knowledge-gaps/), it is important
to focus your chosen problem domain so that it is feasible for you to conduct
research in this area. For instance, this might involve focusing on the price of
sneakers, or the way in which video games influence mental health, or how
certain team strategies influence the likelihood of winning an athletic game.

In addition to thinking about areas of your own interest, it is a good idea to
review existing online data science blogs that have already focused on one or
more problem domains. Here are some examples for you to consider:
